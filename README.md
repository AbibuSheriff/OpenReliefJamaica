## 🇯🇲 OpenRelief Jamaica  
**Founder:** Abibu Sheriff  
**Purpose:** A free national emergency and disaster reporting platform built to improve crisis response in Jamaica.  
**Tech:** Base44, Firebase, JavaScript, APIs

### 🚨 What This App Does  
- Citizens can report emergencies in real-time  
- Disaster workers can view incidents on a live map  
- Allows fast communication during hurricanes and national crises  
- Helps countries without a strong 911/112/999 system

### 💡 Why I Built This  
I developed OpenRelief during Jamaica’s recent hurricane crisis. The country struggled with communication, delayed responses, and lack of verified information.  
I built this to help save lives, support emergency teams, and modernise Jamaica’s disaster infrastructure.
